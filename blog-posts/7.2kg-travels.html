        <li>Fiji - November 2023</li>
        <li>US/Mexico - December 2023</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the year of travelling solely with carry-on luggage. 100ml liquids and being as faithful to my 7kg allowance as I can. The sneaky 200g is just for the books that I pick up along the way - I think that's allowable.</p>
	<p>Reads picked up from hotel in Uluwatu, "Love Affair" by Leslien Kenton and "The House of New Begginings" by Lucy Diamond. One that made it back with me, "All That I Am" by Anna Funder.</p>

<p>Aside from basking in the heat and humidity of Bali, a little highlight of this getaway was busting out “Happy Birthday” in Indonesian … in Indonesia! And blessedly joined by the delighted wait staff presenting the slice of birthday cake.</p>
<p>A shout out to Mr Frost who perservered with a motley crew of high school students to make this happen. Frosty also taught us how to cook Nasi Goreng, which is one of the recipes that has stuck with me from childhood and was still addicted to whilst in Bali.</p>

<h3>Activities</h3>
    <p>After a few leisurely days, reading by the pool and wandering the streets of Legian/Kuta for tasty eats and very generous massages, the last two days were for activities!</p> 
    
<h4>Paragliding</h4> 
    <p>Taxiing on the back of a scooter is so much fun. The organised chaos of the streets of Bali is astounding and the understanding between four and two wheels is remarkable.</p>
    <p>Grab didn&#39;t recognise my destination so I confirmed a location nearby figuring I could walk the rest of the way upon arrival. Thankfully a handpainted sign for “Nyang Nyang Paragliding” pointed me to my destination and my driver waited for me to complete my flight to take me back!</p>
    
    <p>I&#39;m not sure how the pilot feels, but as a passenger I find paragliding so enjoyable. We didn't get up as high as I did in Turkey, but it was smooth sailing, until the crash landing on the beach. Kidding Mum!! A super safe and well planned landing.</p> 
    
	<p>I met another girl from the UK who was travelling South-East Asia for as long as her funds would allow. We grabbed a bite to eat in Uluwatu afterwards for a chin wag before going our own ways.</p>

<h4>Ubud</h4>
    <p>Monkey Forest Ubud: Sacred Sanctuary, Tegalalang Rice Terrace and Waterfall.
    Monkey park - a little Forrest haven to wander around and come across the monkeys. They may be up for a fight, nicking your gopro.</p>
    
<h3>Gastronomy appreciation </h3>
    <p>As a lazy cook, I am a standard meat and three veg kinda gal. Mostly just to fuel the tank to accommodate the various activities of my weekly schedule.</p>
    
    <p>But my tastebuds were awakened in Bali. Thanks to my mate Kirrily, we always had a place to go. We happened to be at one temple, appreciating the shade after wandering the grounds, and it was suggested that perhaps we could have an early lunch.</p>
    <p>“Oh, I know a place we can check out for some Babi Guling (suckling pig).” 
    Of course she did! After lurking around some obscure alley ways, we came across the delightful low-key joint and devoured the simple meaty dish, roasted over the fire and cooked to perfection.</p>
    
    <p>Some places to save in your own Google maps app, just in case you happen to be there any time soon.</p> 
    
    <h4>Barbacoa, Seminyak</h4>
    <img src="../images/barbacoa.heic">
        <p>Such tasty dishes at <a href="https://barbacoa-bali.com/">Barbacoa</a>, beautiful location, swift delivery of food and drinks, pleasant staff.</p> 
    
    <h4>La Favela</h4>
    <img src="../images/la-favela.png">
        <p>Love the digs of <a href="https://lafavelabali.com/">La Favela</a>. There is a bar for vodka, gin, tequila and whiskey.</p>
    
    <h4>Motel Mexicola</h4>
        <p>Not quite a bang for your buck at <a href="https://motelmexicola.info/">Motel Mexicola</a>. It is quite pricey (for Bali standars) and their Pisco Sour didn&#39;t live up. But I liked the vibe, with some authentic Mexican music playing and it was a happening place.</p> 
    
    <h4>Fat Chow</h4>
        <p>Best Asian Fusion in Kuta is <a href="https://fatchowbali.com/home/">Fat Chow</a> (and the best caramel espresso martini&#39;s).</p> 
    
    <h4>Kopi Pot</h4>
        <p>Super chill, just grabbed a beer and some satay chicken sizzling over the coals at <a href="https://www.kopipot.com/en/kopipot-kuta-bali.html">Kopi Pot</a>. Enjoyed the shade and cool air under the trees.</p> 
    
    <h4>Gelato</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/venchi_id/?hl=en">Venchi</a> at Beachwalk shopping centre. Just make sure that you enjoy it in the airconditioning! As soon as we stepped outside it started running furiously and we had to capture the goods as fast as possible. The flavours were very gentle and super smooth texture.</p>
    
    <h4>Jimmy's Falafel</h4>
    <img src="../images/jimmys-falafel.heic">
        <p>A sneaky shout out to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jimmysfalafel/?hl=en">Jimmy's Falafel</a> at central Sydney, where we grabbed a late bite after landing and checking in to our hotel. Fun decor, very busy and a delicious bite to eat (with an tasty accompanying cokctail).</p>
