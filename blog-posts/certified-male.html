	<p>International Comedy Hit &ldquo;Certified Male&rdquo; came to Malta in October 2019, produced by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/existstagerightmalta/"><strong>Exit Stage Right</strong></a>&lsquo;s CEO Nanette Brimmer and starred renowned performers Alan Montanaro, Alan Paris, Joseph Zammit and Stephen Oliver (pictured).</p>
    <p>Written by award-winning Australian writers and performers Scott Rankin and Glynn Nicholas, the show tells the story of three middle-management men who have been coerced into attending an exotically-set weekend workshop of company strategy planning by their boss. All manner of hilarious surprises and mishaps await them at their mystery destination, intensified by the men&rsquo;s distinct impression that one of them may not be returning to work on Monday.</p>
    <p>Breakfast always tastes better the second time around. Just ask these guys …</p>

	  <p>Comprising four actors and an on-stage piano player, Certified Male uses a sumptuous theatrical blend of dramatic scenes, stand-up comedy song and choreographed physical set pieces to tell its story. Since nearly all the show&rsquo;s props are mimed, the cast attended a rigorous mime &lsquo;boot camp&rsquo; with Nicholas, to help them create scenarios such as imaginary fishing boats and golf courses or perhaps encounters with monkeys and jellyfish!</p>
      <p>Brimmer was delighted to finally get a hold of the rights, something she had been tracking down for decades.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I had been chasing this production for a number of years. So, not only was I over the moon when I acquired the rights, but I hit the jackpot when Glynn Nicholas – one of the authors – suggested he comes over to Malta to co-direct. I met Glynn when I was in Australia, November 2018. He&rsquo;s a well-known, award-winning personality, but he&rsquo;s a down-to-earth, irrepressible optimist… and so funny! Staging Certified Male alongside him is going to be a lot of fun!&rdquo;</p>
