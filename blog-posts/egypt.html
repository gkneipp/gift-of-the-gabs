	<h2>Abu Simbel</h2>
  <p>King Ramses II had 74 wives and 150 kids. His favourite wife (…one of the last ones? The most beautiful?) was declared to be Nefertari and she earned her own little temple on the side.</p>
  <p>It was a group favourite visiting the site, spectacular to see and even more impressive because it was relocated when the Aswan Dam was built and threatened to submerge the site.</p>
  <h2>Felucca down the Nile</h2>
  <p>Destined for Luxor (formerly Thebes). It was so comfortable, with the deck lined with a massive mattress for us to each reserve a space and dump our belongings. Occasionally we would go up top to enjoy the sun, by then absconded to tbe shade down below.</p>
  <p><em>Side note: The food we had on the boat, was so impressive and absolutely delicious. Every time, we couldn&rsquo;t resist more helpings. Just a simple rice and vegetable dish – from the herbs and spices used? I need. to know. </em></p>
  <p>At night, we docked the boat, lit a campfire and danced witb the Nubians. A lot of fun.</p>
  <h2>Valley of the Kings</h2>
  <p>Nothing much to see on the outside a plain of sand and rocks. But underneath, an incredible arrangement of tunnels with intelligent design, no wall left without being inscribed of hieroglyphs, sacred caevings explained.</p>
  <p>Although tomb robbers and treasure hunters managed to clean up most of the Valley, this was a surprise find. I am very glad that this portion was left for us to visit.</p>
  <p>This is 5t principal burial place of Pharaohs from 11-16th Century BC Tombs of Seti I, Remses VI, Tutankhamen.</p>
  <p>Tut&rsquo;s tomb is so well known because it is the most well preserved. But it wasn&rsquo;t a favourite because it is very small and there is just a small ledge to look over the outer layer of the tomb (the inside layers are at the Cairo museum, which we saw and quite incredible) and his golden sarcophagus, which there was a line for and a guard keeping our viewing limited. His mummy was there though, not well preserved but he still looked quite real.</p>
  <p>Seti&rsquo;s was the best. It was the largest in the valley and very grand. Many rooms and it went down deep. I was in utter awe of its natural preservation and the colours that are still so vivid.</p>
