  <p>Overall findings;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The delights of heated toilet seats, Japan&rsquo;s gift to humankind (there are many more functions available, but I won&rsquo;t go into depth).</li>
    <li>A hedgehog café would be a hit.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Should you care to delve a little more about what I have been up to …</p>
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <p>When I arrived, was picked up by a cousin who has been here for the last 15 years, so I was well looked after. His twin boys, Ethan and James are six years old and they kept us busy! To set them loose they took me over the bay in Odaiba, which is home to a little replica of Statue of Liberty, a 20 metre Transformer and some ice cream that is combined with many layers of fairy floss around the cone. That night we went to a restaurant that became very famous as it was used in <em>Kill Bill</em>, I am going to actually have to watch that movie now.</p>
  <p>The next day we went to Kamakura to visit the Kotokuin Temple (Great Buddha) which was a nice drive out of the City. When we went out for sushi that night, James dressed up to go out in his Batman costume. Love the confidence of this kid.</p>
  <p><em>Side note #1: It is so safe and easy to get around in Japan that kids travel by themselves. My cousin will send his boys to kindergarten by themselves. on a train today there was a group of about eight, six or seven year olds (I am terrible guessing ages of kids, to me they are just tiny humans) traveling without adult supervision.</em></p>
  <p>On the third day I met my travel buddy Jadah, who I had met in Atlanta two years ago. We travelled well together in Costa Rica so I got in touch with her asking if she would be up for a trip and if so, when and where. Which is what brought me to Japan! </p>
  <p>On our first day together, we checked out Harajuku, the kaleidoscope of fashion. Among other things, we were introduced to Purikura, the photo booth game where you end up with small sticker pictures in different poses as directed by an anime ie. peace signs, gazing in the distance etc. Full of twelve-year old girls combing each other&rsquo;s hair, fixing themselves up in the mirrors to be prepared for the shoot. Crazy! After that, we enjoyed a hot chocolate while cuddling tiny little hedgehogs. Correct, we just got to nurse them and feed them some dry grubs. Autumn was going for $5000. Thus began my collection of &ldquo;things that GK did not buy&rdquo;. It took some strength. Especially walking down the street after, they have a lot of interesting things that I am sure I would make good use of.</p>
  <p>That night, we hit up the Robot Restaurant for an entertaining show. We arrived a touch early so we were warmed up with some performers beforehand. There seemed to be an Elton John impersonator, the band dressed up like Ziggy Stardust and girls clad with a resemblance of clothing. We were then directed down the stairs, surrounded by luminous and cheerful wallpaper before we were settled into our seats. I don&rsquo;t even know how to describe it, just watch the video for some insight!</p>
  <p>We also visited the Digital Art Museum, which has been designed to be &ldquo;borderless&rdquo;, tearing down the borders between the art its viewers. So, it is an interactive experience and fun to wander through.</p>
  <h2>Kyoto</h2>
  <p>An overnight bus took us to Kyoto. Thankfully we had booked our hotel the night before so when we arrived were able to check in and head to our capsules.</p>
  <p><em>Side note #2: Capsule hotels are SO COOL. Despite sharing with another 12 or 25 other people there is still the privacy and it is cosy.</em></p>
  <p>Wanting a chill day, we found some Hot Springs just outside of the city, up in the mountains. It was really quiet up there, so we chose very well and while in the baths it started snowing outside which was absolutely beautiful. On the train ride back into town, we were investigating lunch options and came across a Ramen cooking class so that&rsquo;s where we went. It wasn&rsquo;t an entirely engaging course. We were given the instructions on a small flip chart and everything was pretty much prepared for us step by step. Not that I am trying to be a professional chef, so it was funsies.</p>
  <p>Tourist destinations visited: the Golden Pavilion, Bamboo Forrest. Wandering through the Nishiki markets was great, lots of foods that visually don&rsquo;t make sense, until eventually we practically yelled at a very helpful store owner to point us in the direction of a sushi train. This led to success.</p>
  <p>That night we went out looking for some Karaoke. Japan does this different to us. Trying to track down a pub where the patrons were in full swing, we ended up in a very quiet place where you go with your friends, rent a room and it a more private occasion. So, we went on the hunt for something else and came across a sign for Darts. Heading up the stairs we ended up walking inside a very cosy and intimate jamming session, they were utterly curious as to why we were there. I didn&rsquo;t mention that I thought we were finding a game of darts, just that we wandered on up and were pleasantly surprised. They loved having us there, keen for us to sing some songs (I gave them some <em>Waltzing Matilda</em>). But there was a really impressive girl performing, her name is Yoko (a good stage name) and she has a strong, wide vocal range and I really enjoyed hearing her play.</p>
  <p>Next day we went hunting a Pottery class, where after our hotel staff were very helpful calling many places we secured one that could nudge us through it without any English. Not quite a pottery artist, didn&rsquo;t need to keep the mug that I made so that didn&rsquo;t make the list of things to keep. Afterwards we wandered up to a very popular temple and experienced being amongst such ancient artefacts when snow started falling heavily, it looked lovely.</p>
