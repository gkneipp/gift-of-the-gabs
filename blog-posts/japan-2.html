 <p class="date">February 2, 2019</p>
  <p>I headed down to Osaka and farewelled my travel buddy back to Miami. I mostly just wandered around the city, but the place to be is Dotonbori which is a strip full of restaurants, bars, cafes grabbing your attention by gaudy neon lights, extravagant signage and so much colour. Its purpose is to basically eat until you drop. My favourite was Takoyaki, large slices of octopus in a batter that they cook in small cuts of a hotplate yummmeh.</p>
  <p>I did a day trip to Nara, which was Japan&rsquo;s first permanent capital city named to be so in 710. Until, the influence and political ambitions of powerful Buddhist monasteries grew in the region, becoming a serious threat to the government. So, the capital was moved to Nagaoka, Kyoto and finally Tokyo after then. It is a very picturesque city filled with temples, shrines and parks filled with deer. They wander around freely and are fed with excitement by many tourists as although they do enjoy grass and leaves, their FAVOURITE food are the crackers on sale. They weren&rsquo;t a big fan of me, as they would curiously inch closely forward but lost interest after a quick sniff of my empty hand.  </p>
  <p>Then I headed back to Tokyo, this time staying in Shibuya which is quite well known for its super Insta worthy pedestrian crossing. It is so busy that while you wait to cross the road, check out an ad on the massive screens.</p>
  <p>Now, a really cute part of this neighbourhood is <em>Hachiko&rsquo;s Exit</em> just outside of the train station. A bronze statue has been erected in honour of the dog by the same name. After his owner died, Hachiko still came to the train station to wait for his owner to arrive back from work, waiting each day for him for 9 years. Isn&rsquo;t that a little bit sweet? There has even been a movie made about it (get the tissues ready and check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6U7mAnPtw4"> Hatchi: A Dog's Tale trailer</a>. It has Richard Gere in it – need I say more?)</p>
