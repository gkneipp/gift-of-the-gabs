<h2 id=portland>Portland</h2>
<p>Back in 2019, the first stop of my post-Uni gap year was Japan. Whilst awaiting a tour of the Imperial Palace Easy Gardens in Tokyo, I got chatting with a lovely couple from the US, Eric and Hollie, and after the tour we grabbed lunch and have since kept in touch.</p>

<img src="../images/IMG_9334.jpeg" alt="gabrielle standing in the middle with her friends Eric at the left and Hollie on the right" class="gift-gabs-visuals">

<p>They visited when I was living in Malta, got to take them to the <a href=“https://www.birgucandles.mt/blogs/relax-with-wax/birgu-is-a-world-record-holder”>Birgu Candlelight Festival</a> and show off the Australian-owned restaurant <a href="../blog-posts/two-buoys.html">Two Buoys</a>. Now it was my turn to visit and see what Portland has to offer.</p>

<p>Got started with an “off the road” bike tour with <a href="https://www.bikesandmunchies.com/">Bikes and Munchies</a>. Our guides were very knowlegable and explained the history and culture of Mexico very well. A great selection of food and drinks to feel very Mexican.</p>

<p>Like pulque, which is a drink native to Mexico, made from the fermented sap of the agave plant (which needs 12 years of maturation). Similar to kombucha, it can come in any flavour and we were treated to the natural flavour, guava, oats and celery. Very tasty but thankfully just shot glass size, the normal pint size would be a bit much!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/experiences/1361427?viralityEntryPoint=2&s=76&unique_share_id=A968B669-9AB0-491B-810A-611F36B0A8E2&_branch_match_id=1272667205427682193&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXT0zKS9LLTdVP883yca80tChwSwIAsyccvRsAAAA%3D">Taco and Mezcal tour</a>: now super knowledgable about what else the agave plant has to  offer. A special surprise - snake infused tequila and ant eggs. </p>

<h4>M&#233;rida</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Uxmal was a great site to visit. Very out of the way, a lot of ground to cover, huge temples, and enjoyed the guided tour. Feels more authentic than Chitzen Itza which has received a lot of refurbishment and given its closeness to Cancun and Tulum so popular for massive tourist crowds.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g150811-d8333990-Reviews-Cafeteria_La_70-Merida_Yucatan_Peninsula.html">Cafeteria la 70</a>: a relaxed patio area is nice and comfortable to start the day with. The service was friendly and excellent, with a wide variety of food and drinks.</li>
	<li><a href="https://cantinanegrita.com/">La negrita</a>: noisy, chaotic and lots of fun! The waiters are too busy being conscious of the packed room, but drinks and food will come, enjoy the live music and have a dance.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Tulum</h4>
<p>Tulum main strip of resorts/hotels and beach is hella expensive. But you can easily settle in on the beach with your own supplies. The water was so clear and pleasant. Some favourite eateries that we became regulars at:</p>
<ul>  
<li>Of course the ruins of Tulum are spectacular, I have always admired the chosen location of the Mayan civilisation. Love a good view. We went snorkelling with the fishies and sting rays at a beach right by them.</li>
<li>Cenotes are water-filled sinkholes that naturally occur in limestone rock when an underground cave collapses in on itself and exposes the groundwater underneath. The water is cold, as it comes from underground, and crystal clear so they are very refreshing from the hot Mexican sunshine. We went to <a href="https://cenotesmexico.org/cenote-yaxmuul/">Yax-Muul</a> which isn't a single cenote, but rather a nature park with four cenotes. It's rather tucked away down a dirt road so it was nice and quiet.</li>
<li><a href="https://zamnafestival.com/">Zamna Festival</a>: was a massive hype, an icon of electronic music worldwide.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lapebetatulum/?hl=en">La pebeta</a> - delicious Argentinian pastries </li>
<li><a href="https://www.raumgallery.com">Raum</a>: Japanese an absolute fave of one of my mates so we visited repeatedly!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/palmacentraltulum/?hl=en">Palma Central</a>: loads of fun. A salsa dance class was underway while we were there, multiple food trucks to choose food / drinks so everyone has something to choose from. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Bacalar </h4>
<p>A truly enchanting and off-the-beaten-path location. The pristine waters of the natural lagoon are unforgettable, and the lovely and culturally rich Pueblo makes Bacalar a best-kept secret. </p>
<p>Los Rápidos: you can walk out on the boardwalk until you are ready to jump in and float back with the current, but we hired a kayak to venture out a little further to the lagoon and enjoyed a vast, tranquil landscape and diving off . </p>
<ul> 
	<li><a href="https://picaflor.com.mx/">Picaflor</a>: has a serene little garden and provide boardgames which was perfect for us.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/madre_masa_bacalar/?hl=en">Madre Masa</a>: the cinammon roll a tasty little treat and well tended to by the waitstaff.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.laplayitabacalar.com/">La Playita</a>: very relaxed right by the water and a boardwalk to enjoy a nightly stroll after dinner/drinks.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cancun</h4>
<p>We were just here for stopovers. Be wary of how expensive taxis are. Uber not available, but you could get lucky with DiDi (sometimes you just need to wait out matching with a driver).</p>
<p>A huge childhood dream achieved for one fellow traveller was <a href="https://www.cocobongo.com/show/cancun/?lang=en">Coco Bongo</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Keep an eye on the weather, if it is raining the roads will be flooded and hard to navigate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kayaked out in the lagoon to watch the sunrise, flamingo's, crocodiles and different bird species.</li>
<li>Spent Christmas day on a boat ride out to other islands and fishing for a catch, to enjoy ceviche at lunchtime</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrhappyholbox/">Mr Happy</a>: Wait a while for your meal, but the drinks were delivered quickly and there was best mocha I had in Mexico. A very happy place indeed.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, it wasn't the season for them, but would have loved to go swimming with the <a href="https://holboxadventure.com/holboxwhalesharktours.html">whale sharks</a> and seen the <a href="https://www.holboxtravel.com.mx/en/tours/holbox-bioluminescence/?fh-u=16c56b70-f575-4bdd-b367-277cae0370b8">bioluminescence</a>.</li>

<p>A 25 minute ferry ride from Cancun, this island is a very relaxed paradise.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.selina.com/mexico/isla-mujeres/">Selina Hostel</a> - super chill vibes. Walking distance from the ferry terminal, situated right on the beachfront, complete with a cocktail bar, seafood restaurant, library zone, cinema room, and hosting a range of events; live music, group workshops, fitness activities etc.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.pocnadivecenter.com">Pocna Dive Center</a> is also located within the hostel premises which is where I undertook my Open Water PADI dive certificate! Had a brilliant time achieving this one and delighted to visit the <a href="https://musamexico.org">MUSA underwater museum</a> and dive amongst a gorgeous reef. The water was insanely clear and warm.</li>
