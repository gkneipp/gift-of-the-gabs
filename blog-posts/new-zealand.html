<h2>Lake Tekapo</h2>
<p>The perfect location for star gazing! We were there at the time of the new moon and there were so many stars to admire. The galaxy wasn't holding out either.</p>
<p><a href="https://tekaposprings.co.nz/">Lake Tekapo Springs</a> In the colder climate, such an experience to be outside in hot pools admiring the sunset.</p>

<h2>Mount Cook National Park</h2>
<h3>Hoooker Valley Track</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Distance: 10 km return</li>
	<li>Duration: 2 &#8211; 3 hour return.</li>
	<li>Elevation Gain: 100 m</li>
</ul>
<p>The relatively flat hike is easy to follow and very well maintained. Three picturesque suspension bridges to break things up, until entering the Hooker Glacial Lake showcasing the power of New Zealand&#39;s tallest mountain, Mount Cook. The track was icy so the prepared hikers had ice snow grips on their shoes.</p>

<h2>Wānaka</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.lakewanaka.co.nz/explore/that-wanaka-tree/">That Wānaka Tree</a>, the lonely willow, normally situated out in the waters of the lake, but it was very low tide so we were able to walk right up to it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wanakahorsetrekking.com/">Wānaka Horse Trekking</a>: Following a historical pack trail, tracing the footsteps of miners and prospectors back in the days of the gold rush. The trail runs alongside the lake with spectacular views all round. Walking along most of the time, taking in the incredibile landscape, but we did get to canter up the slopes which was so freeing and so much fun.</p>
<p>I loved that the owner, Sam, descibed each horse right off the bat to decide which steed would suit whom the best. I was with Harry who sometimes needed a bit of a nudge, but once he got going, he found his stride!</p>

<p>We swung by <a href="https://www.newzealand.com/au/arrowtown/">Arrowtown</a> briefly, just for a little snoop of the historic gold mining town and purchasing some goodies.</p>
