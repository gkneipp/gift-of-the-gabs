<h4>Day 1</h4>

<p>My sister and I landed in Nairobi in the wee hours of the morning, after meeting at Heathrow airport for the first time in nearly three years. She came to visit me in Malta, March 2020, and we were intended for St Patrick&#39;s Day in Dublin. But COVID left uncertainty as to whether I would make it back to the island so I dropped her off to the airport. Thus our overseas adventures had come to an end!</p>

<p>Following a well deserved nap we commenced hunting down, on foot, two sleeping bags for the Serengeti. Questionable ones were found and disregarded, until at last, supermarket Carrefour finally offered two kid size sleeping bags for us to be satisfied with.</p>

	</div>

<h4>Day 2</h4>

<p>A long trek and a jumpy tour guide (for another group) got us across the border to Tanzania, arriving in the picturesque town of Arusha. Spent the night getting to know our fellow travellers, most of whom had just spent six days hiking Mt Kilimanjaro!! Which is also the name of a local beer we became familiar with, that is known as ”Kili”.</p>

<h4>Day 3</h4>

<p>To the village of Mto wa Mbu with a guided cultural tour through a rice field, banana plantation (red bananas super sweet, not a fan of banana beer, banana wine kind of like cider), woodworkers, artists and a traditional lunch. (The tribe of this part of the country are the Maasai - they wear brilliant coloured traditional clothes, herd the goats and cattle on the side of the highway, enjoy rice, stews and vegetable dishes). </p>

<p>In the afternoon we had a sneaky introductory wildlife safari drive by Lake Manyara. Countless baboons, several elephants and giraffes were also sighted.</p>

		<h3 id="serengeti">Serengeti National Park</h3>
		<p>Vast, sandy plains packed with huge herds of wildebeests and zebras nervous to approach the hippo-filled rivers for fear of the crocodiles and being hunted by lionesses. Herds of elephants cooling down, drinking their fill and basking in the sun. The Ngorongoro Crater one of the highest concentrations of wildlife in Africa, drawing in thousands of flamingos during mating season.</p>

	<h4>Day 4</h4>

			<p>A long and bumpy trek to Serengeti National Park, but upon arrival we got straight to it. </p>
			
			<p>Towers of giraffes, troupes of baboons, countless Gazelles, the funniest were the Grant Gazelles sunning their butts  (literally, just standing separately in their herds with butt&#39;s facing towards the sun to capture the heat). </p>
			
			<p>Dazzles of zebras paired up and in company of the wildebeest. The latter have good hearing and smelling senses but count on the zebras for their memory of safe migration paths and sight. </p>
			
			<p>Came across a lioness guarding the carcas of a buffalo. That would see the family through for 2-3 days. </p>
			
			<h4>Day 5</h4>
			
			<p>Half our group departed early for a hot air balloon ride. They saw a lion on duty this time, guarding the buffalo carcas from the hyenas and vultures. </p>
			
			<p>Fascinating to just watch the animal daily lives. At least a hundred hippos huddled together, pooping, farting and sleeping contentedly while the zebras and wildebeest skittishly approaching the water downstream, wary of the crocs awaiting them. </p>
			
			<p>The mongoose - so cute! Birds are their predators so they scurry from their termite mounds to safety of the bushes. </p> 
			
			<p>Radios in the Jeeps were active with chatter amongst the drivers to keep each other informed of what they have seen and where.</p> 
			
			<p>The cats came out this day - we followed a lioness tracking her pack, going ahead of her we saw other lionesses and her cubs.</p> 
			
			<p>A leopard had taken its kill (antelope) up a tree and was having a nap. It would have already eaten the insides to lighten the load. </p>
			
			<p>A cheetah just napping in the shade. </p>
			
			<p>Oh, and a black face monkey with blue balls.</p>
			
			<h4>Day 6</h4>
			
			<p>Catherine reported hearing the lions breathing in our camp and the hyenas in the kitchen.</p>
			
			<p>We left Serengeti and headed to the Crate of Ngorongoro (which is a caldera, a large cauldron-like hollow that forms shortly after the emptying of a magma chamber in an eruption). </p>
			
			<p>It was a very steep and slow descent but very special. We saw flamingos for the first time, many pumbas and hyenas! We did see two of the latter nibbling away at something, and a cautious Thomson Gazelle about 50m away. She was keeping her distance but couldn&#39;t look away … alas, we think they had her fawn.</p>
			
			<p>Of the Big 5, we missed the rhino. But otherwise got the lion, leopard, African elephant and African buffalo. </p>
			
			<p>Destination - Simba campsite (zebras camping with us!)  </p>
			
			<h4>Day 7</h4>
			
			<p>Traveled back to Arusha, stopping by a Maasai camp, to see the changes being introduced to traditional smoke ovens. Partly sponsored by G Adventures, chimneys were being installed and a stove plate to decrease smoke in the huts. </p>
			
			<h4>Day 8</h4>
			
			<p>A walking tour of Arusha, saw the clock tower which is the centre point of Africa between Cape Town and Cairo. Many markets visited. </p>

	<h4>Day 9</h4>
	<p>A very early flight to Stone Town, Zanzibar from Kilimanjaro airport.</p>
	<p>We visited the old slave market and exhibition, the Freddie Mercury museum and street markets. Watched a beautiful sunset and introduced to Margaronas. Happy days indeed.</p>
	
	<h4>Days 10-12</h4> 
	
	<p>A very relaxed start to the day, before heading to the beach vibe of Jambiani, an old fishing village on the southeast coast.</p>
	
	<p>En route, we stopped at a spice plantation to learn about all the spices that are grown in Zanzibar. Once a time, Zanzibar was the largest producer of cloves in the world.</p>

	<p>Spices were first introduced by the Portuguese back in the 16th century, when they were transported over from colonies in Goa and Brazil. It wasn&#39;t until the Omanis arrived, though, several hundred years later, that the spice trade truly thrived.</p>
		
	<p>Presently, clove production is declining while tourism is skyrocketing, resulting in much of the spice industry turning towards plantation tours as a way to stay in business.</p>
	 
	<p>At our beautiful resort it was 3 days of relaxing, swimming, two rounds of snorkelling - so many starfish in one place! I also had a try at wind surfing which was lots of fun.</p>
	
	<p>One stand out was visiting a restaurant called “the rock”. At low tide you can walk out and access it, but at high tide you need to catch a boat back to shore! (But it was still low enough for us to just take our shoes off and steadily walk back).</p>
