		<p>Taking a week between the end of one job and the beginning of another, it was time to see what Tassie was all about. And I was delighted!</p>
			
		<p>I picked up a car from the airport and freely drove around with a rough itinerary in mind.</p> 
			
		<p>One of the best parts was a visit to Port Arthur. When buying a tour ticket, one is asked their last name and postcode. I secured my ticket and was wandering around the reception when I overheard the cashier asking if the two gentlemen buying their own tickets were “with the young lady” - given the same last name!</p> 
			
		<p>What are the chances?! What if they had gone to a different register to buy their tickets? What if the cashier hadn&#39;t commented about the same last name? They were Dad&#39;s cousins through Grandpa.</p>
			
		<p>After the tour we met again at a distillery down the road and had a good chin wag getting to know each other. The surprises and chances that traveling always has in store for us.</p>
