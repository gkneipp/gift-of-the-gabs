  <h2>Elephants</h2>
  <p>They are such beautiful creatures &ndash; my new favourite thing, added to the list of things that I haven&rsquo;t stolen/bought</p>
  <ol>
    <li>An Elephant</li>
    <li>My uniform from seeing the Elephants</li>
    <li>Hedgehog</li>
    <li>Portable home for the hedgehog.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>They were hilarious as they made it very obvious that we served one purpose … to deliver a portion of their daily 200-300kg of food. There would be at least three of us standing in front of one particular female (in a herd of 35 elephants there were only 2 males) and she went from left to middle to right to get a stick of sugar cane from each of us. Sometimes I would go in for a cuddle and her nose would just be prodding my bag for more. Sometimes I had two in my hand and gave her one, she always came back for the second before putting it in her mouth.</p>
  <p>Each one has their own &ldquo;human buddy&rdquo; and they make a particular cute noise to that person ONLY, not anyone else.</p>
  <p>My favourite part was mashing some bananas with pellets of nuts and balls of herbs which was their treat but also to lines the stomach. While the mashing part wasn&rsquo;t entirely exhilarating, they were rolled into balls and popped directly onto their tongues which were gigantic and so soft.</p>
  <p>So this is what they do, eat every two hours, take a crap not caring where they are or what they are doing and take a bath in between. The life.</p>
  <h2>Ziplining with Flight of the Gibbon</h2>
  <p>…With the gibbons or looking like a gibbon, not quite sure. But zooming through the treetops of this rainforest was great fun, there were many lines to be flown.</p>
  <p>We flew, rappelled, doubled up and jumped &ndash; this design in particular was unexpected. They strapped us into a chest harness and then we just take off without the normal seat and hook to hang on to. When I was ready to go I remember asking – <em>you mean I just jump?</em> Yup! So off I went. It was my guide&rsquo;s first day apparently, but he seemed to know how to run the drill so I was comfortable.</p>
