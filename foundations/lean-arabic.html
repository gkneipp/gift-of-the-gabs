<p>In July 2018, I was part of the <a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/people-to-people/foundations-councils-institutes/caar/stories/Pages/journalism-study-tour-to-qatar-and-jordan-ameje18">Australia-Middle East Journalism Exchange</a> (#AMEJE18) program. 
	
<p>It allowed for a taste of the Middle East, to be able to effectively report to an Australian audience by providing a true understanding of the issues, improving my cross cutural understanding and being better informed.</p>

<p>While in Qatar and Jordan, we took part in professional and cultural activities designed to build our skills and knowledge in an effort to enhance our career prospects.</p>p> 

<p>We visited the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera</a> newsroom in Doha and <a href="https://en.arij.net/">Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ)</a> in Amman.</p>

<p>We also visited cultural institutions, mosques, Petra, and the Jerash refugee camp in Jordan which sparked an ongoing interest in the Middle East.</p>

<img src="../images/doha.JPG" alt="three windows at a mosque in Doha">

<p>We worked especially closely with Middle East University in Amman, working collaboratively on journalism projects while on tour.</p>

<p>One of my most outstanding experiences was meeting with fellow journalists while in Jordan.</p>

<h2 id="HonourCrimes">
<p>In Amman, I reached out to Rana Husseini, a crime reporter with the Jordan Times. For the past 20 years, she has been an activist working to expose so-called honour crimes in the country. Her work has given voice to victims and has helped drive changes in the way these crimes are treated in court. It was an inspiration to have met with her.</p>

<h2 id="LeanArabic">Lean Arabic</h2>
<p>Wanting to have some basic Arabic to take over with me for the program, I undertook a beginner&rsquo;s course with the <a href="https://www.iambe.com.au/">Institute of Australia Middle East</a>. From what I learnt, I produced some easy going podcasts with my teach, Mohanned Kassar, to provide conversational basics for itnerested minds.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will come in handy for a brief stopover in Dubai or when inclined to visit the wonderous Petra for yourself – have a listen!</p>

<p>I joined the #AMEJE18 study tour for the opportunity to develop a better understanding of the Middle East and its people, and to learn how to better uncover and report a range of stories for audiences back home. In the process, I experienced first-hand the change that a journalist can make.</p>
    
<p>The value I took from the #AMEJE18 tour is immeasurable, and was only possible thanks to the support of the <a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/people-to-people/foundations-councils-institutes/caar/council-for-australian-arab-relations">Council for Australian-Arab Relations</a>.</p>
