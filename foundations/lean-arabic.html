<p>In July 2018, Gabrielle travelled to Qatar and Jordan as part of the <a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/people-to-people/foundations-councils-institutes/caar/stories/Pages/journalism-study-tour-to-qatar-and-jordan-ameje18">Australia Middle East Journalism Exchange</a> which contributed significantly to her journalism studies.</p>
<p>It allowed for a taste of the Middle East, to be able to effectively report to audiences by providing a true understanding of the issues and being better informed by the experience.</p>
<p>Gabrielle wanted to have some basic Arabic to take over with her and undertook a beginner&rsquo;s course with the <a href="https://www.iambe.com.au/">Institute of Australia Middle East</a>. With her teacher, Mohanned Kassar, she brought together some easy going podcasts to provide conversational basics.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will come in handy for that brief stopover in Dubai – have a listen!</p>
